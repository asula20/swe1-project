    "Guido van Rossum was looking for an interesting project to keep him occupied during Christmas so he created Python.",
    "the inspiration for the name came from TV Show ‘Monty Python’s Flying Circus’, as the creator of Python was a big dan of it",
    "Python was initially released in 1991 whereas Java was released in 1995. Thus, Python is now almost 30 years old.",
