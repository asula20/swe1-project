Chapters
First the user will see the name of the chapter and the sub-topics that he is going to learn in these chapters. 
Then by pressing a specific button the window will show the next slide. In each slide the user will see the theory,
some examples for that specific topic and some figures that may be charts or explanation. When reaching the end of the chapter,
the screen will show some figures that congratulate the user for his\her progress and a link for revising everything they learned.
